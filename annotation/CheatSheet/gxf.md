The gene-finding format / general feature format  
GFF / GFF1 / GFF2 / GFF2.5 / GFF3 / GTF / GTF2.2 formats
===========================

It's often hard to understand and differentiate all GFF/GTF formats/flavors. Here is an overview of the format and its history to help disentangle this complexity.


## Forewords:
⇨	When I use the term gff it includes all gff formats/flavors. (The first version of the format was not called gff1 but gff. But to make it easier I will always express the version of the format saying gff1 when it's the first version of it. So from now when I say gff it means all gff formats/flavors).  
⇨	I the same way, when I use the term gtf it includes all gtf formats/flavors.  
⇨	I have created the term **gxf** that means all the gff and gtf formats/flavors.
