Results:
1 genes affected and 1 mRNA.

/!\Remind:
 L and M are AA are possible start codons.
Particular case: If we have a triplet as WTG, AYG, RTG, RTR or ATK it will be seen as a possible Methionine codon start (it's a X aa)
An arbitrary choisce has been done: The longer translate can begin by a L only if it's longer by 21 AA than the longer translate beginning by M. It's happened 0 times here.
