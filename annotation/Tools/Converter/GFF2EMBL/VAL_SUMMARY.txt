INFO: organism unclassified. /transl_table identified. Recruiting translation table from /transl_table. Using /transl_table="{0}" (6056 occurrences) (CDSTranslator-13) 
WARNING: Intron usually expected to be at least 10 nt long. Please check the accuracy. (751 occurrences) (intronLengthWithinCDSCheck) 
ERROR: The first source feature location must start at base position 1, not "{0}" (source features must cover the full sequence length). (8 occurrences) (SequenceCoverageCheck-3) 
ERROR: Sequence contains a stretch of 'n' characters between base {0} and {1} that is not represented with a "gap" feature (stretches of n greater than {2} gives a warning, greater than {3} gives an error). (10 occurrences) (SequenceToGapFeatureBasesCheck-1) 
ERROR: "estimated_length" qualifier with value "{0}" must belong to a feature with a total length of {0}, not "{1}" (10 occurrences) (EstimatedLengthCheck-1) 
ERROR: Protein coding feature length must be a multiple of 3. Consider 5' or 3' partial location. (5697 occurrences) (Translator-11) 
ERROR: Protein coding feature with start codon {0} must be 5'' partial. (216 occurrences) (Translator-3) 
ERROR: The protein translation of the protein coding feature contains internal stop codons. Consider a different start codon. (142 occurrences) (Translator-17)
