This is an explanations of the differents test files used to check the GFF3 parser.
Launch the tester.sh script to check the parser and all these files

00: Correct gff3 => Must stay as it is.
01: 4 Exon duplicated + 4 exon missing
02: No Parent attribute, but sorted correctly
03: Same as 2 but with common tag
04: Same as 3 but but 2 features with common tag spread within the file (locus AAAA). Actually the 2 features occurs too early in the file.
05: Same as 3 but but 2 features with common tag spread within the file (locus BBBB). Actually the 2 features occurs too late in the file.
06: Same as 3 but some common tag are missing
07: Same as 3 but some have also parent feature
08: Prokka output => only cds defined, and locus_tag is defined
09: Refseq1: Level1 and level3 linked by ID/Parent ... but level2 missing ... and two UTRs missing
10: Refseq2: level2 missing, the whole is linked by a comon attribute (here locus_tag); No ID attribute ... and 3 UTRs missing
11: Two isoforms of the same locus are not defined one after each other (so, spread...), and the level1 and level2 of those are missing. The two isoforms have to be linked to the same gene
12: ensembl peculiarities case
13: same as 11 but isoforms are identical (one has to be removed)
14: 6 UTRs missing
15: Match / Match_part case (alignement gff). Clean case.
16: One UTR is wrong
17: One exon is badly defined (UTR show that one is a bit longer)
18: features spread
19: some have locus tag, some have Parent
20: 4 Exon are missing
21: Two exon badly defined, they are overlaping. One has to have its location modified and the other one ahas to be completey removed
22: case where UTR both side of an exon... nothing to do, jedst the check has to not perform anything...
23: Mutliparent for the exon feature
24: Not correct SOFA feature type
